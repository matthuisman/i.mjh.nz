    <sub-title>Three Little Pirates, Hugs And Mugs, Hold That Lion, Punchy Cowpunchers, Who Done It, Outer Space Jitters</sub-title>
    <desc>"The Stooges are castaways from a garbage scow who land on Dead Man's Island where everyone is living in olden times.  To escape from the governor, they disguise Curly as a Maharaja and win permission to journey to their own country to fetch presents.  The governor is fooled, but the boys run into more trouble in the den of Black Louie the pirate where Curly is forced into a knife-throwing contest with Larry as the target.  Things look bad until a mis-thrown knife cuts the rope that holds the chandelier and it crashes down on Black Louie's men.  With the pirates defeated, Moe decides to take over as ruler of the island. , The Stooges run a furniture store and come into possession of a stolen pearl necklace.  Three crooked dames convince the boys that the necklace is theirs, and when the real thieves arrive, the Stooges fight to defend the girl's property.  The Stooges defeat the bad guys and the girls decide to go honest and return the necklace to its rightful owner. , The Stooges accompany professor Jones on an expedition to Venus, where they discover that the Venusians are planning to conquer the earth with an army of zombies.  When the boys learn that they're going to be turned into zombies, they escape.  The scene changes to the Stooges apartment where we learn they are just telling a bedtime story to their kids (also played by the Stooges) while they wait for the baby sitter to arrive.  When the baby sitter shows up, she looks like one of the zombies and the boys exit in a hurry. , The Stooges are gypped out of their inheritance by Icabob Slipp, a crooked lawyer.  The boys follow Slipp onto a passenger train and corner him, but not before they accidentally let a lion loose on the train. , Set in the old west, the Stooges are three soldiers assigned to go undercover and spy on an outlaw gang that's terrorizing a nearby town.  The bad guys have the Arizona Kid locked up, so the boys set about rescuing him with the help of beautiful Nell, his girl.  They free the kid, and he rides to summon help.  The Stooges, with the help of Nell, manage to subdue the bad guys before the kid arrives with the cavalry. , The Stooges are private detectives looking for a missing millionaire.  They wander around the millionaire's spooky mansion confronting various crooks and a dangerous dame.  The Stooges vanquish the crooks (Shemp uses his "trusty shovel") and find the missing man.
